Contains list of planned side projects

Project 1:
Excel based term to stock price mapper: Outline: We observe increase and decrease of a stock on the training set for the last 100 to last 50 days, we find the factors that may have been responsible for the increase/decrease in the training set, we then check for increase or decrease in these factors and then see how many times these affected the stock on the test set (last 50 days to today)

Project 2:
Web scraper that given a product name will query the e-commerce websites on different sites and sort by cheapest to highest
The configuration is country --> list of sites to scrape on that country
Follow up: Social network connectivity to identify user's friends in that country from facebook
Follow up2: Members of this site on the country, whether they will travel to user's country soon and their scores (scores indicate how many products they bought for other members)
Homepage lists items with max difference between user's country and some other country where the price of the item is lowest on e-commerce sites
